## project description
This project is a Java Banking App simulator operated through the terminal. The app should store user profiles (usernames/passwords), the banking accounts associated with those profiles (checking/saving), as well as functionality to deposit, withdraw, and other banking functions.
## iteration 1
NOTE: All code is currently in the **dev branch**

**During this iteration, we accomplished the following:**
- `user_profile` class with first name, last name, username (profile ID), SSN, security questions
  - Note: SSN and security questions have not been implemented yet, they are currently just instance variables
- `Bank_Account` class, the parent class for `Checking_Account` and `Savings_Account` with a balance, name, history, getters, deposit, and withdraw.
- `Savings_Account` subclass to `Bank_Account`
- `Checking_Account` subclass to `Bank_Account`
- `Menu` class with the main method that runs a simulation of the banking app
  - helper methods: makeProfile, getUsername, getPassword, getNewAccountType, displayingOptions, getNewAccountName, createNewAccount, getUserSelectionToCreateOrView, getUserToSelectBankAccount, getUserAction, getDepositAmount, getWithdrawAmount.
- `script.sh` file which runs Menu.java

**To run the program, while in the `project-penguins` directory terminal, type `./script.sh`**

**For our next interation, we intend to**
- Write JavaDocs for our methods
- Store multiple users. We currently only allow one user to be created and worked through.
  - in this vein, allow logins that recognize your profile and say "Welcome Back, xxxx!"
- Clean up the main method and other classes methods to follow coding best practices
- Expand user security to need Social Security Number, and a Security Question when creating a profile.
- Add a class/option for an `Offshore Bank Account` with financial loopholes which allow it to accrue interest at high rates

**Is there anything we've implemented that doesn't work?**
- There are some user account fields that aren't being used (but not necessarily not working), so we will implement those in our methods going forward.

## iteration 2

**During this iteration, we accomplished the following:**
- enabled background music with one availible (for now) track. (Useability may depend on updated version of Java and can be hardware dependent.)
 -- added tests for sound in menu class
- Users can make multiple accounts, and can log in and out of them at will.
- majorly refactored main, created utility classes and changed how username and passwords are stored to help in following best coding practices.
  -- added test suite for Pair class, other ParseUtils class is entirely dependent on user input, and all user input is self contained within the class, so no test suites are possible.

**For our next interation, we intend to**
- Create a cleaner interface for the menu object, so that much of the menu can be boiled down to less hard coded menus.
- Expand library of music choices, and allow user to choose music from a curated list. 
- Expand usage of Bank_Account classes, e.g. Savings Accounts have interest applied over time and have a withdrawal limit set based on total money in the account.
- Create new utility classes to help reduce code density, and do away with repetitive code throughout the code base.

**Is there anything we've implemented that doesn't work?**
- Music can be finnicky depending on hardware, some e.g. some antiviruses block Eclipse from accessing speakers, etc.
- Menu testing is largely dependent on user input, however methods can can be tested should be
- Code makes use of many effectively while(true) loops, it is entirely possible that certain inputs could cause an infinite while loop.
