# base-project

Add description of what happened each iteration


Progress for Iteration 1:

So far we have constructed a plan for the project as follows:

We created a parent class BankAccount which will be the parent classes of future bank account types. 
So far we have started SavingsAccount, I think we can try to also implement RetirementAccount and CheckingAccount as other account types.

Every Bank account has core functionalities like deposit and withdrawal so we started making those 
methods in the BankAccount class. We are still discussing how we should differentiate these functionalities between classes. 

I want to also explore the potential of user profiles ( so a user can have multiple accounts) and other features as well(like filing info between sessions for later use)

Edit: We have also integrated user profiles, Users make a user profile with a user name and password that must follow Penguin Banking Incorperated criteria. The test suites provided pass for those purposes. 

TODO: ADD TESTS FOR BANK ACCOUNT METHODS (withdraw and deposit)
TODO: WORK ON THE SH FILE THAT SHOULD RUN THIS THING
